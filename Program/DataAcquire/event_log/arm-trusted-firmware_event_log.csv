Since July 2020 (36766d39e8), u-boot began building all device trees
with symbols unless OF_LIBFDT_OVERLAY is explicitly disabled.

Consequentially, each node in a device tree is assigned a phandle,
regardless of it being actually referenced anywhere. This change made
the selective enablement of only those regulators for which a phandle
is present by the axp driver effectively useless.

In order to reinstate a way of achieving selectivity in what regulators
get enabled, check for a non-'okay' value of the 'status' property.","{""sha"": ""ad6e39c158b741bb32f203147301c10a2553b3f4"", ""author"": {""name"": ""Roman Beranek"", ""email"": ""roman.beranek@prusa3d.com"", ""date"": ""2021-03-15T07:52:17Z""}, ""committer"": {""name"": ""Roman Beranek"", ""email"": ""roman.beranek@prusa3d.com"", ""date"": ""2021-03-15T07:52:17Z""}}"

Thank you for your contribution to **Trusted Firmware-A**!

The TF-A project has now migrated to www.trustedfirmware.org. Our GitHub repo will remain accessible as a Read-Only mirror but we have changed the way we accept contributions for the project.

## How do I contribute patches to TF-A?
We have a [Getting started](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/w/tf_a/gerrit-getting-started/) article which we hope will make everything very straightforward! And if you would like more details you can always refer to the [contributing guidelines](https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/contributing.html).

A quick overview:
1. Go to review.trustedfirmware.org
2. Register with your existing GitHub account
3. Submit your patches!

## What if I face any problems?
We have many channels through which you can contact us:

 * **Our mailing lists**
   You can send us an email in the [public TF-A mailing list](https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/mailman/listinfo/tf-a). [Here](https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/mailman/listinfo) you can also find all the mailing lists for all the projects hosted under trustedfirmware.org.

We are looking forward to seeing your patch submitted to trustedfirmware.org!

This commit adds support for BL32 TEE-RAW.BIN by defaulting
to built-time addresses when FSBL fails at providing a valid
jump address.

By default, BL32 is expected at 0x60000000.
The BIF file to use would be something like this

	      { type=bootloader, file=plm.elf }
